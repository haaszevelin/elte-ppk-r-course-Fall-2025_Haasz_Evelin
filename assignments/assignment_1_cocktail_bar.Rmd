# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(stringi)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
original_cocktail_data <- read.delim("C:/Users/Haász Evelin/Downloads/cocktail_data.tsv", header= TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cleaned_cocktail_data <- original_cocktail_data %>%
  select(name, ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(
    ingredients,
    "\\d+\\s?/?\\d*\\s?(oz|bsp|dash(?:es)?|dashes|drops|g)?|\\([0-9.]+% abv\\)"
  )) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])", " ")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_split(ingredients, "<br\\s*/?>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "<.*?>")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "^[./\\s]+")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "sugard -proof|sugared -proof", "high-proof")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = stringi::stri_unescape_unicode(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = stringi::stri_trans_general(ingredients, "Latin-ASCII")) %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "\u008f", "e")) %>% #
  filter(ingredients != "")
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# list of ingredients
ingredient_list <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  distinct(ingredients)
  arrange(ingredients)       

# checking the results
print(ingredient_list, n= Inf)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
num_unique_ingredients <- n_distinct(cleaned_cocktail_data$ingredients)
num_unique_ingredients

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

top_10 <- top_ingredients %>%
  filter(count >= top_ingredients$count[10])

top_10

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_max_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max(num_ingredients))

cocktail_max_ingredients
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(n_cocktails = n()) %>%
  filter(n_cocktails == 1)

count(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  select(name) %>%
  distinct(name, .keep_all = TRUE)

print(distinct(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients), n = Inf)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  filter(!ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) %>%  
  distinct(name)  

print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients, n = Inf)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
# gathering unique cocktail and ingredient names
cocktails <- unique(cleaned_cocktail_data$name)
ingredients <- unique(cleaned_cocktail_data$ingredients)

# creating an empty matrix
cocktail_matrix <- matrix("", nrow = length(cocktails), ncol = length(ingredients),
                          dimnames = list(cocktails, ingredients))

# "X" for present ingredients
for(i in seq_len(nrow(cleaned_cocktail_data))) {
  cocktail <- cleaned_cocktail_data$name[i]
  ingredient <- cleaned_cocktail_data$ingredients[i]
  cocktail_matrix[cocktail, ingredient] <- "X"
}

# converting to df
cocktail_matrix <- as.data.frame(cocktail_matrix)
cocktail_matrix <- tibble::rownames_to_column(cocktail_matrix, var = "name")

# ingredient columns alphabetically
cocktail_matrix <- cocktail_matrix %>% relocate(name, sort(names(.)[-1]))

# checking result
view(cocktail_matrix)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
